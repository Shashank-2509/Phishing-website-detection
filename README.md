This repository houses a comprehensive codebase focused on detecting phishing websites through machine learning methodologies. Phishing websites represent a critical cybersecurity threat, engineered with the intent to illicitly obtain sensitive data, including login credentials, financial information such as credit card details, and personal data. The primary objective of this project is to cultivate a resilient system capable of swiftly recognizing and flagging such deceptive websites, thus bolstering internet security measures.

By leveraging advanced machine learning techniques, this project endeavors to fortify defenses against the ever-evolving tactics employed by cybercriminals to perpetrate phishing attacks. Through the analysis of various features extracted from legitimate and fraudulent websites, including URL characteristics, presence of encryption protocols like HTTPS, and domain age, the model aims to discern patterns indicative of phishing behavior.

The dataset utilized for training and evaluation purposes provides a comprehensive representation of features crucial for distinguishing between authentic and malicious websites. These features undergo meticulous preprocessing to ensure optimal model performance, including data cleaning, feature extraction, and appropriate partitioning into training and testing sets.

The model training phase encompasses the utilization of diverse classification algorithms, such as Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Gradient Boosting, to discern the most effective approach for phishing website detection. Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score provide insights into the model's efficacy in accurately identifying phishing websites while minimizing false positives and false negatives.

Furthermore, the repository offers real-time prediction capabilities through a dedicated script, enabling users to promptly assess the legitimacy of a given URL. Additionally, detailed analysis and visualization of model performance are provided to facilitate a deeper understanding of the detection mechanisms employed.

Ultimately, this project aims to contribute to the ongoing efforts in cybersecurity by furnishing organizations and individuals with a robust toolset to combat the pervasive threat posed by phishing websites, thus fostering a safer online environment for all users.
